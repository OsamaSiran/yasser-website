# web-app
For my high school graduation project, I did a web application on 1st May, <br/> Now that I am familiar with Git, I would like to publish my project on GitHub.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Tech:</h3>
Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Backend: Node.js<br/>
with frameworks: Express.js, Electron.<br/>
Database: MongoDB.<br/>
Authentication and Authorization: JWT (JSON Web Token).<br/>
<br/><br/>

<h3>Description:</h3>
The idea is to make an app that solves a problem startups have, the problem is how difficult it is to manage employees and calculate revenues and expenses, it would require a lot of employees and money to do it.
<br/><br/>
We started by planning what the app needed to have and after some brainstorms, We agreed on how it should be: <br/><br/>
The login page: 
<ul>
  <li>logo.</li>
  <li>inputs of ID and password.</li>
  <li>A way to authenticate the user and send him to the right page.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The admin page:
<ul>
  <li>Employee management: create, edit, delete, show.</li>
  <li>A way to communicate between the admin and the employees.</li>
  <li>Expenses and revenues display, and it will show the total.</li>
  <li>Storage display.</li>
  <li>Bills display.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The worker page:
<ul>
  <li>Worker information.</li>
  <li>Calender.</li>
  <li>A way to communicate between the admin and the employees.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
Afterwards my friend started designing how the pages should look like, provided the icons and images, and designed the logo.
<br/>
then I did the magic and coded the whole thing, I finished it then found out about Electron so I turned it into a desktop web app,  
<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> The app runs by creating the server locally and listen on port 7543 (in the .env file)
